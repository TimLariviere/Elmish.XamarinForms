This library automates the creation of bindings of existing UI frameworks for Fabulous through a simple JSON file. CodeGen will output an F# code file that you can include in your own project, like Fabulous for Xamarin.Forms.

It can be easily included in a build process, or run manually through a command line tool.

For more information, please take a look at the documentation.
