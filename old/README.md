## Fabulous

This library aims to provide all the core abstractions and tools for writing your own app framework based on the "[model view update](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)" programming model and dynamic UI. It is a variation of [elmish](https://elmish.github.io/), an Elm architecture implemented in F#.

[Learn more about Fabulous](FABULOUS.md)

## Fabulous.CodeGen

This library automates the creation of bindings of existing UI frameworks for Fabulous through a simple JSON file. CodeGen will output an F# code file that you can include in your own project, like Fabulous for Xamarin.Forms.

It can be easily included in a build process, or run via a command line tool.

## Fabulous for Xamarin.Forms

This library allows you to use the ultra-simple Model-View-Update architecture to build applications for iOS, Android, Mac, WPF and more using Xamarin.Forms. It is built on Fabulous.

With Fabulous for Xamarin.Forms, you will be able to write complete applications fully in F#, like this:
```fsharp
type Model = { Text: string }
type Msg = ButtonClicked

let init () = { Text = "Hello Fabulous!" }

let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | ButtonClicked -> { model with Text = "Thanks for using Fabulous!" }

let view model dispatch =
    View.ContentPage(
        View.StackLayout(
            children=[
                View.Image(source = "fabulous.png")
                View.Label(text = model.Text, fontSize = 22.)
                View.Button(text = "Click me", command = (fun () -> dispatch ButtonClicked))
            ]
        )
    )
```
